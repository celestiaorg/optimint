# BlockExecutor

## Abstract

 The BlockExecutor is a component responsible for creating, applying, and maintaining blocks and state in the system. It interacts with the mempool and the application via the ABCI interface.

## Component Description

 The BlockExecutor is initialized with a proposer address, namespace ID, chain ID, mempool, proxyApp, eventBus, and logger. It uses these to manage the creation and application of blocks. It also validates blocks and commits them, updating the state as necessary.

## Detailed Description

- `NewBlockExecutor`: This method creates a new instance of BlockExecutor. It takes a proposer address, namespace ID, chain ID, mempool, proxyApp, eventBus, and logger as parameters.
- `InitChain`: This method initializes the chain by calling InitChainSync using the consensus connection to the app. It takes a GenesisDoc as a parameter.
- `CreateBlock`: This method reaps transactions from the mempool and builds a block. It takes the current state, the height of the block, and the commit as parameters.
- `ApplyBlock`: This method applies the block to the state. It takes the current state, the block ID, and the block itself as parameters.
- `validateBlock`: This method validates the block. It takes the state and the block as parameters.
- `commit`: This method commits the block and updates the state. It takes the state, the block ID, and the block as parameters.
- `execute`: This method executes the block. It takes the context, the state, and the block as parameters.
- `publishEvents`: This method publishes events related to the block. It takes the ABCI responses, the block, and the state as parameters.

## Message Structure/Communication Format

The BlockExecutor communicates with the application via the ABCI interface. It sends and receives ABCI messages, such as RequestInitChain, RequestBeginBlock, RequestDeliverTx, and RequestEndBlock.

## Assumptions and Considerations

The BlockExecutor assumes that the mempool and the application are functioning correctly. It also assumes that the blocks it receives are well-formed and that the state is consistent.

## Implementation

The implementation of the BlockExecutor can be found in the file `state/executor.go`.
