# State Transition Function

## Abstract

This document outlines the state transition function for the Rollkit protocol. The state transition function is fundamental for validating and executing blocks, and orchestrating the protocol's operations through the BlockExecutor structure. The primary functions involved in state transitions include ApplyBlock, Commit, Validate, execute, updateState, and publishEvents.

## Protocol/Component Description

The Rollkit protocol manages a distributed system where states transition based on specific rules and messages exchanged among nodes. The BlockExecutor structure encapsulates the logic for validating, executing, and committing blocks, alongside updating the system state, and publishing events.

## Message Structure/Communication Format

Messages within the Rollkit protocol are structured as specified in the types package. The communication between nodes adheres to a predetermined format ensuring consistency and reliability in state transitions.

## Assumptions and Considerations

* Nodes operate under the same version of the protocol.
* Messages exchanged between nodes are reliable and received in the correct order.
* Network latency and message loss may impact the state transition process.

## Implementation

The state transition logic is implemented within various methods of the BlockExecutor structure, primarily within the ApplyBlock, Commit, Validate, execute, updateState, and publishEvents methods.

ApplyBlock: Validates and executes a block, ensuring consistency with the protocol rules, and updates the state accordingly.
Commit: Commits the block, updating the AppHash and publishing events related to the block and transactions.
Validate: Validates the block against the current state, ensuring consistency in block height, version, and other critical parameters.
execute: Orchestrates the transaction execution within a block, interacting with the application via ABCI (Application BlockChain Interface).
updateState: Updates the state based on the executed block, handling validator updates and other state transitions.
publishEvents: Publishes events related to block and transaction processing, facilitating external observations and interactions.
