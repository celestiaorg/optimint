# State Transition Function

## Abstract

This document delineates the state transition function of the Rollkit blockchain framework, emphasizing its modular architecture and the ABCI-compatible client interface, which facilitates interaction between the blockchain and the application.

## Protocol/Component Description

Overview of the Rollkit framework and its modular architecture.

Description of the ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) and how it enables communication between the blockchain and the application.

Explanation of the state transition function within the Rollkit framework, detailing how it processes transactions and transitions the blockchain from one state to another.

## Message Structure/Communication Format

Discussion on the message structure used in transactions and how these messages trigger state transitions.
Description of the communication format between the application and the blockchain via the ABCI.

## Assumptions and Considerations

Assumptions regarding the network, consensus mechanism, and other integral components of the framework.
Security considerations concerning the state transition function and overall framework operation.

## Implementation

Details on how the state transition function is implemented within the Rollkit framework.
Examples of modularity in the implementation, allowing for customization and extendibility.
